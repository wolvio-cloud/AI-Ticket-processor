3. Click OK

### STEP 7: CONDITIONS TAB

### STEP 9: SAVE AND TEST
1. Click OK at the bottom
2. Enter your Windows password if prompted
3. Find "AI Ticket Processor" in the task list
4. Right-click → Run
5. Check logs folder for new results

### STEP 10: VERIFY IT'S WORKING
After 10 minutes, check:
1. logs/automated_runs.log (should have new entries)
2. logs/YYYYMMDD.log (should have processing logs)
3. logs/results_*.json (new result files every 10 min)

## MONITORING:
Check these files to monitor automation:
- logs/automated_runs.log - All automated run outputs
- logs/YYYYMMDD.log - Detailed processing logs
- logs/results_*.json - Results from each run

## TROUBLESHOOTING:

**Task doesn't run:**
- Check if Task Scheduler service is running
- Verify file paths are correct (no typos)
- Make sure Python is in system PATH

**Python not found:**
- In batch file, change 'python' to full path:
  C:\Users\MadhanKarthickMailsa\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe

**Task runs but tickets not processed:**
- Check logs/YYYYMMDD.log for errors
- Verify .env file is in the correct folder
- Test manually: run_ticket_processor.bat

## MODIFYING THE SCHEDULE:

To change from every 10 minutes to something else:
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Find "AI Ticket Processor"
3. Right-click → Properties
4. Go to Triggers tab
5. Edit the trigger
6. Change "Repeat task every" to your preference:
   - 5 minutes (very frequent)
   - 15 minutes (recommended)
   - 30 minutes (moderate)
   - 1 hour (less frequent)

## TEMPORARILY DISABLE:
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Find "AI Ticket Processor"
3. Right-click → Disable

## PERMANENTLY DELETE:
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Find "AI Ticket Processor"
3. Right-click → Delete

## ESTIMATED PERFORMANCE:

Running every 10 minutes:
- Checks: 144 times per day
- New tickets processed: ~10-50 per run
- Cost per day: ~$0.30 - $1.50
- Cost per month: ~$10 - $45
- Time saved: ~40-80 hours per month

Running every 5 minutes:
- Checks: 288 times per day
- Cost per month: ~$20 - $90
- Nearly real-time processing!

## COST OPTIMIZATION:

To reduce costs:
1. Change limit from 50 to 10 (only process 10 newest)
2. Run every 15-30 minutes instead of 10
3. Add filter to only process untagged tickets

## RECOMMENDED SETTINGS FOR PRODUCTION:
- Schedule: Every 10 minutes
- Limit: 50 tickets
- Expected cost: ~$15-30/month
- Expected tickets: 500-1500/month
- Time saved: 40-120 hours/month
- Cost saved: $2,000-6,000/month

Your net savings: $1,970-5,970/month!
